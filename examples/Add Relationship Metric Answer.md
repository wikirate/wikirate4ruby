## Add Relationship Metric Answer

_Wikirate platform can host answers that respond to relationship questions between companies. For instance, which
companies supplied company A in 2022? Relationship answers respond to such questions (metrics with metric type
Relationship Metric)._

This example assumes you have configured your Wikirate REST `client`. Instructions on how to configure a client can be
found in [examples/Configurations.md](https://github.com/wikirate/wikirate4ruby/blob/main/examples/Configuration.md)

WikiRate's REST API allows you to import not only research metric answers but also relationship answers. wikirate4ruby
provides the method `add_relationship_metric_answer` to facilitate this functionality and allow users to import
relationships. The method takes as an input a number of parameters where all the information about the new relationship
is defined. The parameters can be split into required and optional.

<div style="font-family:'Source Code Pro'; font-size:14px; padding-left: 0.5em; padding-right: 0.5em;">

required params:

- **_metric_designer_**: the designer of the metric we want to add the answer to
- **_metric_name_**: the metric name/title of the metric we want to add the answer to
- **_subject_company_**: the company name/id of the subject company
- **_object_company_**: the company name/id of the object company
- **_year_**: the year the relationship is referred to
- **_value_**: the value/answer to the question
- **_source_**: wikirate's source name of the source we found the mentioned relationship

optional params:

- **_discussion_**: any comments we might have on the answer

</div>

The example below demonstrates the import of a relationship to the _Commons_ metric _Supplied By_

```ruby
relationship = client.add_relationship_metric_answer({ 'metric_designer' => 'Commons',
                                                       'metric_name' => 'Supplied By',
                                                       'subject_company' => 'Aldi Sud',
                                                       'object_company' => 'Zhejiang Bangjie Digital Knitting Share Co. Ltd.',
                                                       'year' => 2019,
                                                       'value' => 'Tier 1 Supplier',
                                                       'source' => 'Source-000092586' })
```
